# Pressure sensor case for NanoSen PCN Sensor kit

The PCN Sensor Kit from [NanoSen](https://nanosen.de/pnc-sensor-kit/) offers high resolution for applications requiring pressure sensors. When integrating NanoSen sensors, an enclosure may be needed to protect the sensor or to allow for its reuse across different applications. For example, it might be necessary to glue the sensor in place to achieve more accurate and repeatable results.

The sensor case presented here is designed based on the dimensions of the NanoSen sensor and is easy to open. This allows the case to be securely glued for a specific application while still enabling the sensor to be reused later by simply opening the case. The enclosure can be easily produced using additive manufacturing and the following files:
1. A [base](https://github.com/giuseppesanseverino/CADmodels/blob/main/Base_SensCase_v2.stl), where the sensor is placed.
2. A [button](https://github.com/giuseppesanseverino/CADmodels/blob/main/Button_SensCase%20v1.stl), which is placed on top of the sensor after it is inserted into the base.
3. A [top ring](https://github.com/giuseppesanseverino/CADmodels/blob/main/Top_SensCase_v2.stl), which can be pressed onto the base, securely encapsulating the sensor.
